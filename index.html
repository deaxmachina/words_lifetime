    <div class="article-body">
      Have you ever wondered. How many words do we say in a lifetime?
      A quick google search reveals an answer right away – <span class="bold">860,341,500 words</span>. Amazing, job done. If only. As with any exact number 
      retrieved in answer to a complex question, it was, of course, just one (more confident) man’s estimate. 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyles_Brandreth" target="_blank" class="link">Gyles Brandreth’s</a> to be more precise.
      The English writer, broadcaster, actor, and former politician, made the estimate in the early 80s, based on the assumption that 
      an average person speaks about 30,000 words a day – or about 4 hours of continuous talking – over a lifespan of 80 years. 
      This is supposedly stated in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Lex-How-Have-Words/dp/068801397X" target="_blank" class="link">The 
      Joy of Lex: How to Have Fun With 860,341,500 Words</a>. I must confess, I did not go and read the book to verify. Moreover, 
      it has rebranded its title, and I couldn't find it on <a href="https://www.gylesbrandreth.net/books" target="_blank" class="link">the official online bookshop</a>, so 
      who knows 🤷🏼‍♀️. It seems to have been a real number, however. That is a lot of talking if you ask me. Enough to terrify 
      any self-respecting introvert. On a more serious note, it would be interesting to compare how things have evolved over time, 
      with the advent of text-based communication, desk-bound jobs, and especially in the past year – with many of us (me) home alone and 
      passing whole days without speaking to a single soul. 
      <br><br> 
      Anyway. The number itself is not a bad number. For our (very non-scientific 👩🏼‍🔬) purposes, however, we will take it as an upper estimate. 
      We will come up with our own number, because why not. Let’s start by stating our assumptions. We shall take English, and focus on 
      native English speakers, and in particular North American ones. We will consider voiced words only, rather than sign language or 
      written communication. This is for no other reason but data availability. I would love to make a comparison with different languages, 
      although <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594" target="_blank" class="link">some work</a> has been done to show that the estimate will be not that far off. This has to do with the 
      relationship of speech speed and information that different languages pack into a single word (or syllable to be more precise). 
      It’s actually pretty interesting. ✨
      <br><br>
      Our final assumption will be that an average native English speaker born in the last, say 40 years for simplicity (I am a Millennial 🥑, 
      of course my generation is the most interesting), speaks verbally continuously for an average of 1 hour a day every day. While I’m 
      pulling this out of no-where, the number we arrive at in the end is in the same order of magnitude as many estimates I found, which 
      you can check out in my references section. So we’re good. 
      <br><br> 
      Now then, dear reader, let us take our assumptions for a spin. 💫
      <br>
      Oh, and, we are going to be measuring our precious words in units of Harry Potter books 📚. The goal is to make you contemplate how rich 
      you could have been if only you wrote your words down instead of wasting them into the air. I joke. It is just for fun. And to put 
      things into perspective. To leave you with one more curious piece of trivia - on average, a Harry Potter book has 
      <span class="bold">154,881</span> words in it. The total for all 7 books has <span class="bold">1,084,170</span>.

        <h3>👼🏻 Baby talk</h3>
        <br>
        At around 12-18 months old, babies start to vocalise simple words. In American English, the <span class="bold">top 10 most common words</span>, 
        according to <a href="https://langcog.github.io/wordbank-book/items-consistency.html" target="_blank" class="link-blue">the Wordbank Project</a>, are 
        on the left. Interestingly, it turns out that there are overlaps in the concepts 
        behind the words in many languages, which possibly has roots in babies’ desire to be included in social interactions. 
        The Wordbank Project has open-sourced tonnes of interesting data and research!

        <h3>🎒 By the time you start school...</h3>
        <br>
        Imagine you’re an average native English speaker. (If you don’t have to imagine it, feel free to imagine a cute kitten or 
        puppy instead.)
        <br>
        You utter an average of about <span class="bold">135 words a minute</span>. That is <span class="bold">8,100 words an hour</span>. 
        If you speak for only 1 hour in a day, every day, that amounts to <span class="bold">2,956,500 words a year</span>. 
        That is already almost 3 times the entire Harry Potter series. 
        By the time you start school, at roughly 6 years of age, you will have uttered about <span class="bold">14,782,500 words</span>. 
        (We omit the first year of life here). That is 95.44 Harry Potter books there already.         
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step-3">
        <h3>🎓 By the time you finish high school...</h3>
        <br>
        at the ripe old age of 18, you will have voiced out 2,956,500 words a year x 17 years = <span class="bold">50,260,500 words</span> = 324.51 Harry Potter books. 
        87 times the entire Lord of the Rings series. The entirety of the 20 volumes of the printed version of Encyclopaedia Britannica 
        (44 million words) at least once. Maybe twice. Maybe more if you’re particularly chatty.

        <h3>A whole lifetime of 💬</h3>

        <p class="step-4-text">
          The average lifespan of North Americans as of 2019 is 79 years, according to the Word Bank. 
          Subtracting from that the first year, but assuming constant chattiness throughout one’s life, with our conservative estimate of 1 hour a day 
          of actual speech we get…

        <p class="step-4-text">...or 213 times the entire Harry Potter series.
          By the way, that equates to ~100 billion books sold. Just making sure we answered that question. 💸
